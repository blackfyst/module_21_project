# module_21_project
Adding three files: 
- employees-with-date.csv: Input csv file with employees and start date.
- start_date_report_original.py: Original script which iterates through the whole list for each employee. The longer the list, the longer the script takes to run. To be optimized.
- start_date_report.py: Refactored script that, thanks to sorted(), iterates through the list of employees only once, thus that script is much less costly for the same end result.
